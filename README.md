# HED-CoreML

Holistically-Nested Edge Detection (HED) using CoreML and Swift

This is the repo for [tutorial](https://medium.com/@s1ddok/holistically-nested-edge-detection-on-ios-with-coreml-and-swift-e45df264cf66), that contains an example application that runs HED (based on this [repo](https://github.com/s9xie/hed)) on `UIImage` and displays results of different output models.

It also contains examples on how to handle missing layers and use model's side outputs.
